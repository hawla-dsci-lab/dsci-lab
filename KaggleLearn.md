## Main course dsci

<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning>

* 1 How Models Work: The first step if you're new to machine learning
* 2 Basic Data Exploration: Load and understand your data
* 3 Your First Machine Learning Model: Building your first model. Hurray!
* 4 Model Validation: Measure the performance of your model ? so you can test and compare alternatives
* 5 Underfitting and Overfitting: Fine-tune your model for better performance.
* 6 Random Forests: Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning>

* 2 Missing Values: Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.
* 3 Categorical Variables: There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning
* 4 Pipelines: A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing
* 5 Cross-Validation: A better way to test your models
* 6 XGBoost: The most accurate modeling technique for structured data
* 7 Data Leakage: Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways

<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization>

* 2 Line Charts: Visualize trends over time
* 3 Bar Charts and Heatmaps: Use color or length to compare categories in a dataset
* 4 Scatter Plots: Leverage the coordinate plane to explore relationships between variables
* 5 Distributions: Create histograms and density plots
* 6 Choosing Plot Types and Custom Styles: Customize your charts and make them look snazzy

<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas>

* 1 Creating, Reading and Writing: You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.
* 2 Indexing, Selecting & Assigning: Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!
* 3 Summary Functions and Maps: Extract insights from your data.
* 4 Grouping and Sorting: Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters
* 5 Data Types and Missing Values: Deal with the most common progress-blocking problems
* 6 Renaming and Combining: Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together

<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering>

* 1 Baseline Model: Building a baseline model as a starting point for feature engineering
* 2 Categorical Encodings: There are many ways to encode categorical data for modeling. Some are pretty clever.
* 3 Feature Generation: The frequently useful case where you can combine data from multiple rows into useful features
* 4 Feature Selection: You can make a lot of features. Here's how to get the best set of features for your model.
