  abstract = {Objective: The goal of this study is to identify, review, and analyze the published research works that used network analysis as a tool for understanding the human collaboration on different levels of software development. This study and its findings are expected to be of benefit for software engineering practitioners and researchers who are mining software repositories using tools from network science field.
Method: We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we analyzed a number of selected papers from different digital libraries based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results: We identified 35 primary studies (PSs) from four digital libraries, then we extracted data from each PS according to a predefined data extraction sheet. The results of our data analysis showed that not all of the constructed networks used in the PSs were valid as the edges of these networks did not reflect a real relationship between the entities of the network. Additionally, the used measures in the PSs were in many cases not suitable for the used networks. Also, the reported analysis results by the PSs were not, in most cases, validated using any statistical model. Finally, many of the PSs did not provide lessons or guidelines for software practitioners that can improve the software engineering practices.
Conclusion: Although employing network analysis in mining developers' collaboration showed some satisfactory results in some of the PSs, the application of network analysis needs to be conducted more carefully. That is said, the constructed network should be representative and meaningful, the used measure needs to be suitable for the context, and the validation of the results should be considered. More and above, we state some research gaps, in which network science can be applied, with some pointers to recent advances that can be used to mine collaboration networks.},

  abstract = {Combining big data and machine learning algorithms, the power of automatic decision tools induces as much hope as fear. Many recently enacted European legislation (GDPR) and French laws attempt to regulate the use of these tools. Leaving aside the well-identified problems of data confidentiality and impediments to competition, we focus on the risks of discrimination, the problems of transparency and the quality of algorithmic decisions. The detailed perspective of the legal texts, faced with the complexity and opacity of the learning algorithms, reveals the need for important technological disruptions for the detection or reduction of the discrimination risk, and for addressing the right to obtain an explanation of the automatic decision. Since trust of the developers and above all of the users (citizens, litigants, customers) is essential, algorithms exploiting personal data must be deployed in a strict ethical framework. In conclusion, to answer this need, we list some ways of controls to be developed: institutional control, ethical charter, external audit attached to the issue of a label.},

Issues related to choice on modeling technique, estimation procedure (or algorithm) and efficient execution can present significant challenges. For example, selection of appropriate and optimal models for big data analytics often requires careful investigation and considerable expertise which might not always be readily available. In this paper, we propose to use semantic technology to assist data analysts and data scientists in selecting appropriate modeling techniques and building specific models as well as the rationale for the techniques and models selected. To formally describe the modeling techniques, models and results, we developed the Analytics Ontology that supports inferencing for semi-automated model selection. The SCALATION framework, which currently supports over thirty modeling techniques for predictive big data analytics is used as a testbed for evaluating the use of semantic technology.},

An online survey methodology was employed to collect data including Big Five personality traits (NEO-FFI-R), impulsivity (BIS-11), sensation seeking (ImpSS), and demographic information. The data set contained information on the consumption of 18 central nervous system psychoactive drugs. Correlation analysis demonstrated the existence of groups of drugs with strongly correlated consumption patterns. Three correlation pleiades were identified, named by the central drug in the pleiade: ecstasy, heroin, and benzodiazepines pleiades. An exhaustive search was performed to select the most effective subset of input features and data mining methods to classify users and non-users for each drug and pleiad. A number of classification methods were employed (decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian mixture, probability density function estimation, logistic regression and na\textasciidieresis\i ve Bayes) and the most effective classifier was selected for each drug. The quality of classification was surprisingly high with sensitivity and specificity (evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation) being greater than 70\% for almost all classification tasks. The best results with sensitivity and specificity being greater than 75\% were achieved for cannabis, crack, ecstasy, legal highs, LSD, and volatile substance abuse (VSA).},

  abstract = {It is conventional wisdom in machine learning and data mining that logical models such as rule sets are more interpretable than other models, and that among such rule-based models, simpler models are more interpretable than more complex ones. In this position paper, we question this latter assumption by focusing on one particular aspect of interpretability, namely the plausibility of models. Roughly speaking, we equate the plausibility of a model with the likeliness that a user accepts it as an explanation for a prediction. In particular, we argue that\textemdash all other things being equal\textemdash longer explanations may be more convincing than shorter ones, and that the predominant bias for shorter models, which is typically necessary for learning powerful discriminative models, may not be suitable when it comes to user acceptance of the learned models. To that end, we first recapitulate evidence for and against this postulate, and then report the results of an evaluation in a crowdsourcing study based on about 3,000 judgments. The results do not reveal a strong preference for simple rules, whereas we can observe a weak preference for longer rules in some domains. We then relate these results to well-known cognitive biases such as the conjunction fallacy, the representative heuristic, or the recogition heuristic, and investigate their relation to rule length and plausibility.},

In data mining over web, the accuracy of selecting necessary data according to user demand and pick them for output is considered as a major challenging task over the years. This paper proposes an approach to mapping data over the web 3.0 through ontology and access the required data via an intelligent agent. The agent provides all the searched data related to user query from which user can find desired information. When the user does not have sufficient search parameter, knowledge can be perceived from the information provided by the agent. The derivation of such unknown knowledge from the existing can be achieved by semantic web mining. We present an intelligent agent-based web mining model where users' query is being searched by following existing traditional way, e.g. by Google. The intelligent agent checks the searched data and derives only those are the semantically related to users search parameter. A work-in-progress case study of University Faculty Information presented to examine the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The AUC has many merits, such as objectivity and ease of interpretation. However, since it is class indifferent, its usefulness while dealing with highly skewed data sets is questionable, to say the least. In this paper, we propose a simple alternative scalar measure to the AUCindex, the Area Under an Kappa curve (AUK). The proposed AUK-index compensates for the above basic flaw of the AUC by being sensitive to the class distribution. Therefore it is particularly suitable for measuring classifiers' performance on skewed data sets. After introducing the AUK we explore its mathematical relationship with the AUC and show that there is a nonlinear relation between them.},

In the Semantic Web area, initially topic and trend detection was primarily performed through qualitative, top-down style approaches, that rely on expert knowledge. More recently, data-driven, bottom-up approaches have been proposed which can offer a quantitative analysis of the research field's evolution. In this paper, we aim to provide a broader and more complete picture of Semantic Web topics and trends by adopting a mixed methods methodology, which allows a combined use of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Concretely, we build on a qualitative analysis of the main seminal papers, which have adopted a top-down approach, and on quantitative results derived with three bottom-up data-driven approaches (Rexplore, Saffron, PoolParty) on a corpus of Semantic Web papers published in the last decade. In this process, we both use the latter for ``fact-checking'' on the former and also derive key findings in relation to the strengths and weaknesses of top-down and bottom-up approaches to research topic identification. Overall, we provide a reflectional study on the past decade of Semantic Web research, however the findings and the methodology are relevant not only for our community but beyond the area of the Semantic Web to other research fields as well.},

  abstract = {A Search Join is a join operation which extends a user-provided table with additional attributes based on a large corpus of heterogeneous data originating from the Web or corporate intranets. Search Joins are useful within a wide range of application scenarios: Imagine you are an analyst having a local table describing companies and you want to extend this table with attributes containing the headquarters, turnover, and revenue of each company. Or imagine you are a film enthusiast and want to extend a table describing films with attributes like director, genre, and release date of each film. This article presents the Mannheim Search Join Engine which automatically performs such table extension operations based on a large corpus of Web data. Given a local table, the Mannheim Search Join Engine searches the corpus for additional data describing the entities contained in the input table. The discovered data is then joined with the local table and is consolidated using schema matching and data fusion techniques. As result, the user is presented with an extended table and given the opportunity to examine the provenance of the added data. We evaluate the Mannheim Search Join Engine using heterogeneous data originating from over one million different websites. The data corpus consists of HTML tables, as well as Linked Data and Microdata annotations which are converted into tabular form. Our experiments show that the Mannheim Search Join Engine achieves a coverage close to 100\% and a precision of around 90\% for the tasks of extending tables describing cities, companies, countries, drugs, books, films, and songs.},

  abstract = {It is commonly understood that machine learning algorithms discover and extract knowledge based on data at hand. However, a huge amount of knowledge is available which is in machine-readable format and ready for inclusion in machine learning algorithms and models. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates domain knowledge in form of ontologies/hierarchies into logistic regression using stacked generalization. Namely, relations from ontology/hierarchy are used in stacking manner in order to obtain higher, more abstract concepts. Obtained concepts are further used for prediction. The problem we solved is unplanned 30-days hospital readmission, which is considered as one of the major problems in healthcare. Proposed framework yields better results compared to Ridge, Lasso, and Tree Lasso Logistic Regression. Results suggest that the proposed framework improves AUC by up to 9.5\% on pediatric datasets and up to 4\% on morbidly obese patients' datasets and also improves AUPRC by up to 5.7\% on pediatric datasets and up to 2.6\% on morbidly obese patients' datasets on average. This indicates that the inclusion of domain knowledge improves the predictive performance of Logistic Regression.},

While there are many cases where hierarchic relations between features exist, most existing feature selection approaches are not capable of exploiting those relations. In this paper, we introduce a method for feature selection in hierarchical feature spaces. The method first eliminates redundant features along paths in the hierarchy, and further prunes the resulting feature set based on the features' relevance. We show that our method yields a good trade-off between feature space compression and classification accuracy, and outperforms both standard approaches as well as other approaches which also exploit hierarchies.},

The tasks performed in that field are knowledge intensive and can often benefit from using additional knowledge from various sources. Therefore, many approaches have been proposed in this area that combine Semantic Web data with the data mining and knowledge discovery process. This survey article gives a comprehensive overview of those approaches in different stages of the knowledge discovery process. As an example, we show how Linked Open Data can be used at various stages for building content-based recommender systems. The survey shows that, while there are numerous interesting research works performed, the full potential of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data for data mining and KDD is still to be unlocked.},

They present opportunities as well as challenges to statisticians. The role of computational statisticians in scientific discovery from big data analyses has been under-recognized even by peer statisticians. This article summarizes recent methodological and software developments in statistics that address the big data challenges. Methodologies are grouped into three classes: subsampling-based, divide and conquer, and online updating for stream data. As a new contribution, the online updating approach is extended to variable selection with commonly used criteria, and their performances are assessed in a simulation study with stream data. Software packages are summarized with focuses on the open source R and R packages, covering recent tools that help break the barriers of computer memory and computing power. Some of the tools are illustrated in a case study with a logistic regression for the chance of airline delay.},
